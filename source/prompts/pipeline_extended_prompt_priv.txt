Extract structured data from this file and return it following the **Page schema**.

---

### ** General Instructions**
- The document contains data in the format of **paragraph entries categorized by state and formatted into columns**.
- The page heading contains the year. 
- Text is formatted in two or three columns. 
- Data is grouped by state, which is given in sub-headers in the columns. The paragraphs that follow a state sub-heading either have an origin and/or terminus in the state. 
- Within each state grouping, projects are listed by paragraph. Floating indents indicate the separation of paragraphs. 
- Usually, one paragraph contains descriptions for a single pipeline project, which should correspond to a single EntryPrivate object from the Page scheme. However, sometimes one paragraph will describe multiple, distinct pipeline projects; in these cases there will be multiple EntryPrivate objects, each corresponding to a unique and distinct project described in the paragraph. **Important consideration: if a paragraph describes a pipeline that is interstate from end to end, but consists of multiple segments, some of which may be intrastate and some which may be interstate, the entire pipeline should be listed in a single entry as an interstate line.**
- There may sometimes be news reporting at the start of a page before the data entries start. This must be ignored. 
- There may sometimes be advertisements in the middle of a page. This must be ignored. 
- ** All letters are in the English alphabet and all words and names are in the English language**
- **Do NOT omit any projects described in the entries**.

### ** Page Handling Rules**
- **Do not omit any projects that are described in the text, and do not create or make up any projects.**

### **Extraction Rules**
1. **State Heading** --> Found in sub-headers of the text columns, which are centered and bolded. Must be a valid U.S. state name. If the heading describes a geographic region rather than a state, enter "Other". If the heading describes a geographic region within a state, only enter the valid U.S. state name and ignore the geographic descriptors (for instance, "Texas Gulf Coast" should be entered simply as "Texas"). If the heading is missing, enter "UNK". 

2. **Pipeline Company Name --> The company name is sometimes found in the first line of the paragraph, but not always. Sometimes, the pipeline company name is mentioned as a shorthand in the possessive form (e.g., "Sun's" or "Stanolind's"). This is sometimes bolded, though not always. Be careful not to confuse the pipeline company with the location, which is also sometimes bolded. There are sometimes multiple companies, if this is the case then separate the names with a semicolon followed by a space. Only include the primary pipeline companies with ownership over the project. Ignore any mentions of contractors or construction company. 

3. **Fuel Type Raw** --> The type of fuel which is explicitly described in the paragraph. *Use the original terminology* in the text, (i.e., if the paragraph uses the term "gasoline", do not simplify this to "gas", or vice versa). For data in 1950, beware that the fuel type is actually in the header and not explicitly described in each entry paragraph. If the fuel type is not explicitly mentioned, enter "UNK". If the pipeline has been converted, enter the new fuel type, not the old fuel type. 


4. **Fuel Type Inferred** --> If the Fuel Type Raw is *not* "UNK" and *not* "GAS", then directly copy the entry from Fuel Type Raw. Otherwise, if the Fuel Type Raw was "UNK", please try to infer the fuel type. If the Fuel Type Raw was "GAS", then please infer whether the fuel is actually "GASOLINE", "NATURAL GAS", or "GAS (AMBIGUOUS)". Please use contextual clues as well as knowledge about the company, including the company name and other publicly available information about any commodities the company specializes in. **However, if there is any uncertainty about the fuel type, please write "UNK"**, because the accuracy of the fuel type is very important. **Do not make up any information.** If you must infer based on historical knowledge of the company, **be sure not to confuse similar-sounding company names.** You may also use volumetric units to infer fuel type (for instance, "barrel" would allow you to infer "PETROLEUM (AMBIGUOUS)"). "PETROLEUM (AMBIGUOUS)" is a catch-all term for liquid fuel types that can't be further distinguished (for instance, if a company may deal in multiple types of petroleum products that can't be inferred in greater detail). 

5. **Construction Complete** --> The construction completion status can usually be inferred from verb usage. For instance, this is true if the company "completed", "laid", or "installed" the pipeline (though other similar verbs may also be used). This is false if, for example, the entry indicates the company "proposed", "is building", "is constructing", "abandoned", "held", or paused the pipeline (though other verbs may also be used). 

6. **Total Pipeline Length** --> The total mileage of the pipeline, which is described explicitly in almost every paragraph. May be written as a string, integer, fraction, or decimal in the paragraph. Your output should be numeric values. If this information cannot be found, write "UNK". 

7. **Pipeline Diameter** --> The diameter of the pipeline in inches, if provided. If the paragraph describes multiple sections with different diameters, list all the diameters separated by a semicolon followed by a space. This is not described for all pipelines; if it is missing, write "UNK". Your output should be numeric values. 

8. **Pipeline Length by Diameter** --> If there are multiple pipeline diameters specified, we would like a separate mileage corresponding to each diameter. Multiple mileages should be separated with a semicolon followed by a space, and the listed order should match the order of the corresponding diameter. However, if there is no mileage breakdown by segment, write "UNK". If there is only a single constant pipeline diameter, or the diameter is not given, this value should be equal to the total pipeline length. 

9. **Origin City** --> The city in which the pipeline originates. This is not described for all paragraphs (oftentimes, either the city or county will be named but not both). If it is not explicitly named, *do not infer this*, but write "UNK". The Origin City should be a valid U.S. city or town. 

10. **Terminus City** --> The city in which the pipeline terminates. This is not described for all paragraphs (oftentimes, either the city or county will be named but not both). If it is not explicitly named, *do not infer this*, but write "UNK". The Origin City should be a valid U.S. city or town. 

11. **Origin County** --> The county in which the pipeline originates. This is not described for all paragraphs (oftentimes, either the city or county will be named but not both). If it is not explicitly named, *do not infer this*, but write "UNK". The Origin County should be a valid U.S. county. 

12. **Terminus County** --> The county in which the pipeline terminates. This is not described for all paragraphs (oftentimes, either the city or county will be named but not both). If it is not explicitly named, *do not infer this*, but write "UNK". The Origin County should be a valid U.S. county. 

13. **Other Origin Information** --> Optional variable to track other miscellaneous information related to the origin of the pipeline. For instance, the paragraph may mention the name or geographic region of gas field, oil field, tank farm, pump station or other point of reference, which should be recorded for this variable. If other origin information is not described in the paragraph besides the origin state, city, or county, simply write "NA". 

14. **Other Terminus Information** --> Optional variable to track other miscellaneous information related to the terminus of the pipeline. For instance, the paragraph may mention the name or geographic region of gas field, oil field, tank farm, pump station or other point of reference, which should be recorded for this variable. If other terminus information is not described in the paragraph besides the terminus state, city, or county, simply write "NA". 

15. **Origin State** --> The state of the pipeline origin. This is usually not described explicitly in the paragraph and must be inferred from the state heading, origin city, origin county, or other origin descriptions. The state heading should correspond to either the origin state and/or the terminus state, but it does not always correspond to both; for instance, sometimes it only corresponds to the terminus state. If this information cannot be determined, enter "UNK". 

16. **Terminus State** --> The state of the pipeline terminus. This is usually not described explicitly in the paragraph and must be inferred from the state heading, terminus city, terminus county, or other terminus descriptions. The state heading should correspond to either the origin state and/or the terminus state, but it does not always correspond to both. If this information cannot be determined, enter "UNK". 

17. **Interstate or Intrastate** --> Whether the pipeline is interstate or intrastate. This must be inferred from the origin state and terminus state, because it is never explicitly stated in the text. **VERY Important considerations: If a paragraph mentions that a pipeline segment is part of a larger interstate line, then the segment should be coded as interstate, even if the segment starts and ends strictly within a single state.** If there is one segment that is interstate and one segment that is intrastate, the entire pipeline should be considered interstate. If the pipeline project is a loop connected to a larger, interstate pipeline, the loop segment should be considered interstate, even if the loop starts and ends strictly within one state. 

18. **New Construction** --> True if the project constructs a new line, False otherwise. New construction is often implied by verbs such as, but not limited to, "constructed", "completed", "constructing", "laid", or "installed" lines. You may generally infer that the construction is new unless otherwise indicated by terminology such as "reversed", "converted", "reconditioned", or other language indicating a modification of an existing pipeline.

19. **Parallel or Loop** --> Whether it is indicated that the pipeline is constructed in parallel to an existing line, or that the line is a "loop"/"being looped"/"looping", which is the same thing. 

20. **Function** --> The function type of the pipeline, such as transmission, distribution, gathering, fielding, or other. Oftentimes this is not explicitly described by the paragraph, in which case you should write "UNK". 

21. **Connection** --> Whether it is indicated that the project is a connection or extension to an existing pipeline. 

22. **FPC** --> Whether the FPC is mentioned in relation to the project.
