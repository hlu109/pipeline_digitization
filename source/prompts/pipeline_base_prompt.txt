Extract structured data from this file and return it following the **Page schema**.

---

### ** General Instructions**
- The document contains data in the format of **paragraph entries categorized by state and formatted into columns**.
- The page heading contains the year. 
- Text is formatted in two or three columns. 
- Data is grouped by state, which is given in sub-headers in the columns. The paragraphs that follow a state sub-heading either have an origin and/or terminus in the state. 
- Within each state grouping, projects are listed by paragraph. Floating indents indicate the separation of paragraphs. 
- Usually, one paragraph contains descriptions for a single pipeline project, which should correspond to a single EntryPrivate object from the Page scheme. However, sometimes one paragraph will describe multiple, distinct pipeline projects; in these cases there will be multiple EntryPrivate objects, each corresponding to a unique and distinct project described in the paragraph. 
- There may sometimes be news reporting at the start of a page before the data entries start. This must be ignored. 
- There may sometimes be advertisements in the middle of a page. This must be ignored. 
- ** All letters are in the English alphabet and all words and names are in the English language**
- **Do NOT omit any projects described in the entries**.

### ** Page Handling Rules**
- **Do not omit any projects that are described in the text, and do not create or make up any projects.**

### **Extraction Rules**
1. **State Heading** --> Found in sub-headers of the text columns, which are centered and bolded. Must be a valid U.S. state name. If the heading describes a geographic region rather than a state, enter "Other". If the heading describes a geographic region within a state, only enter the valid U.S. state name and ignore the geographic descriptors (for instance, "Texas Gulf Coast" should be entered simply as "Texas"). If the heading is missing, enter "UNK". 

2. **Pipeline Company Name --> Found at the start of each new paragraph and bolded. There are sometimes multiple companies, if this is the case then separate the names with a semicolon followed by a space. Only include the primary pipeline companies with ownership over the project. Ignore any mentions of contractors or construction company. 

3. **Fuel Type** --> The type of fuel is usually explicitly described in the paragraph. Use the original terminology in the text, (i.e., if the paragraph uses the term "gasoline", do not simplify this to "gas"). For data in 1950, beware that the fuel type is actually in the header and not explicitly described in each entry paragraph. **Only if the fuel type is not explicitly mentioned,** then you may try to infer it from the company name, if the company specializes in a particular fuel type. Otherwise, enter "UNK". 

4. **Construction Complete** --> The construction completion status can usually be inferred from verb usage. For instance, this is true if the company "completed", "laid", or "installed" the pipeline (though other similar verbs may also be used). This is false if, for example, the entry indicates the company "proposed", "is building", or "is constructing" the pipeline (though other verbs may also be used). 

5. **Pipeline Length** --> The mileage of the pipeline, which is usually described explicitly in each paragraph. May be written as a string, integer, fraction, or decimal. If this information cannot be found, enter the value -1. If this information is not applicable, enter the value -2. 

6. **Origin State** --> The state of the pipeline origin. This is usually not described explicitly in the paragraph and must be inferred from the state heading, origin city, origin county, or other origin descriptions. The state heading should correspond to either the origin state and/or the terminus state, but it doesn't not always correspond to both; for instance, sometimes it only corresponds to the terminus state. If this information cannot be determined, enter "UNK". 

7. **Terminus State** --> The state of the pipeline terminus. This is usually not described explicitly in the paragraph and must be inferred from the state heading, terminus city, terminus county, or other terminus descriptions. The state heading should correspond to either the origin state and/or the terminus state, but it doesn't not always correspond to both. If this information cannot be determined, enter "UNK". 

8. **Interstate or Intrastate** --> Whether the pipeline is interstate or intrastate. This must be inferred from the origin state and terminus state, because it is never explicitly stated in the text. 

- For any string values that cannot be determined from the given information, enter "UNK". For any string values that are not applicable, enter "NA". 

- For any numeric values that cannot be determined from the given information, enter the value -1. For any string values that are not applicable, enter the value -2. 
- For any variables with multiple values, separate the values using a semicolon followed by a space.

### **Output Rules**
- For any string values that cannot be determined from the given information, enter "UNK". For any string values that are not applicable for a paragraph, enter "NA". 
- For any numeric values that cannot be determined from the given information, enter the value -1. For any numeric values that are not applicable for a paragraph, enter the value -2. 
- For any variables with multiple values, separate the values using a semicolon followed by a space. 
- **Do NOT add in any made up data that does not appear in the text or can be inferred from the text.**
- **Follow the response schema provided** (`Page`).
- **Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors or scanning distortions in state names**
  - Do not modify valid state names
  - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid state name
- all letters are in the English alphabet
- **Most importantly, do NOT omit any projects.**

### ** Important Constraints**
- **Ensure all states and projects from the page are included.**
- **Do NOT omit any projects.**
- **Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors or scanning distortions in state names**
  - Do not modify valid state names
  - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid state name
  - Within each page, state headers are listed in alphabetical order.
- ** If you cannot figure out a row value then enter "UNK" for string values or -1 for numeric values.**
- ** If a row value is not applicable for a particular project, then enter "NA" for string values or -2 for numeric values.**
