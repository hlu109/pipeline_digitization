### ** General Instructions**
- The document contains data in the format of **paragraph entries categorized by state and formatted into columns**.
- The heading contains the year. 
- Text is formatted in two or three columns. 
- Data is grouped by state, which is given in sub-headers in the columns. The paragraphs that follow a state sub-heading either have an origin and/or terminus in the state. 
- Within each state grouping, projects are listed by paragraph. Floating indents indicate the separation of paragraphs. 
- Usually, one paragraph contains descriptions for a single pipeline project, which should correspond to a single Entry object from the Page scheme. However, sometimes one paragraph will describe multiple, distinct pipeline projects; in these cases there will be multiple Entry objects, each corresponding to a unique and distinct project described in the paragraph.   
- The pipeline company is usually given at the start of the paragraph and is typically bolded. 
- ** All letters are in the English alphabet and all words and names are in the English language**
- **Do NOT omit any projects described in the entries**. 
- **Ensure correct page output**: Only output the data for the page located in position PAGE_PLACEMENT in the file.

### **Extraction Rules**
1. **Page Number** → PAGE_PLACEMENT, as indicated by the page location in the file.

   - NEIGHBORHOOD DEV PROG
   - DEMOLITION
5. **Project Attributes**:
   - **Type (Column 2)** → Single-letter code.
   - **ID Number (Column 3)** → Format: single letter-number (e.g., R-60).
   - **Planning Date (Column 4)** → Format: YY-MM, empty, or "NONE".
   - **Execution Date (Column 5)** → Format: YY-MM, empty, or "NONE".

### **Output Rules**
- **Ensure correct nesting**:
  - **States contain a list of cities**.
  - **Cities contain a list of projects**.
  - **Each project and its attributes are in a single row.**
    - ** A project must have a type attribute from column 2 or an id attribute from column 3**.
- **Provide an empty string where table values for a requested field are blank.**
- **Do NOT add in any made up data that does not appear in the table**
- **Follow the response schema provided** (`Page`).
- **Most importantly, do NOT omit any projects on page PAGE_PLACEMENT**
- **Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors in states names.**
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a state
- **Use knowledge of U.S. cities and counties to correct minor spelling errors or scanning distortions in city and county names**
    - Do not modify valid city and county names
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid city or county name
    - all letters are in the English alphabet

### ** Important Constraints**
 **Ensure all states, cities, and projects for page PAGE_PLACEMENT are included.**
 **Do NOT omit any projects on page PAGE_PLACEMENT.**
**Use knowledge of U.S. states to correct minor spelling errors in states names.**
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a state
**Use knowledge of U.S. cities to correct minor spelling errors in city names**
    - Do not modify valid city names
    - Do not make major changes to the string if you cannot match the string to a valid city name
    - Within each state, cities are **almost always listed in alphabetical order**
**Use knowledge of U.S. streets and neighborhoods to correct minor spelling errors ONLY in project names**
** If you cannot figure out a state or a city name then leave it blank. **
**If Execution Date is not blank, then Planning Date must not be blank.**
**If Completion Date is not blank, then Execution Date must not be blank.**
**For dates in the format YY-MM,  the 'YY' is a number between 49 and 75, and the `MM` is a number from 01 to 12 (inclusive). Any date outside this range is invalid.**
