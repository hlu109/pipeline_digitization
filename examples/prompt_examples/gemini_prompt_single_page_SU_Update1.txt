### **Extraction Rules**
For each entry, extract
1. Eviction Reason
    - First, check if there is a **visible mark** (`x`, `X`, checkmark, filled box, or clearly darkened area inside the box) in the **first** checkbox.
    - Second, check if there is a **visible mark** (`x`, `X`, checkmark, filled box, or clearly darkened area inside the box) in the **second** checkbox.
    - Third, check if there is a **visible mark** (`x`, `X`, checkmark, filled box, or clearly darkened area inside the box) in the **second** checkbox.
            - A checkbox is considered **marked** only if there is a visible symbol or darkened area **inside the checkbox** itself.
            - Do **not** count adjacent printed text as a mark. Text located near or to the left of a checkbox does **not** indicate that it is marked unless there is an actual visible mark inside the checkbox.
    - If there is **ONLY** a mark in the **first** checkbox, extract and return the text to the right of the checkbox which corresponds to ""Plaintiff(s)"
    - If there is **ONLY** a mark in the **second** checkbox, extract and return the text to the right of the checkbox which corresponds to "Plaintiffs Attorney"
    - If there is **ONLY** a mark in the **third** checkbox, extract and return the text to the right of the checkbox which corresponds to "Plaintiffs Agent".
    - If **neither** the first, nor the second, nor the third checkbox is marked, return: "missing"

Ignore all other information in the document.
