### **Extraction Rules**
2. **Entry Attributes**:
    - Each row with data in Column 1 (Classificação) corresponds to one Entry object
    - **entry Classificação (classification number)** → Found in the first column, is an integer.
    -**entry Inscrição (enrollment number)** → Found in the second column, is in the format "00000". Keep all five digits including leading zeros.
    - **entry titular** → A string found in the third column, is a Name in portuguese.
    - **entry titular CPF number** → A string found in the fourth column, in the format of "000.000.000-00"
    - **entry conjuge_nome (name)** → A string found in the fifth column, it is a Name in portuguese.
    - **entry conjuge_CPF number** → A string found in the sixth column, in the format of "000.000.000-00"
    - **entry category**:
        - Found in a header block that **always begins with `LISTA DOS`**, followed on the next line by either:
            - **`SORTEADOS`** → return `"winner"`
            - **`SUPLENTES`** → return `"reserve"`
        - Then followed by a line containing **`GRUPO`**.
        - **Ignore** any header that does **not** contain either `SORTEADOS` or `SUPLENTES`. All entries under such a header are skipped.
        - Category applies to all subsequent entries until a new header block (starting with `LISTA DOS`) or page end.
    - **entry group**:
        - Found in the same header block, after the text `GRUPO`.
        - Group applies to all subsequent entries until a new `GRUPO` line or a new header block is encountered.
    - **Remember, if there is not the word "SORTEADOS" or "SUPLENTES" in the header, ignore all the subsequent entries under that header until you reach the next header that contains one of those two words.
